"""Mixture model + flow for the unbinned J/ψ mass calibration.

Two-stage continuity design. The flow models only the NOMINAL (θ=0) mass shape
``p₀(m | muon_kin)`` and never conditions on θ; the θ-dependence is supplied
analytically in stage 2 (the continuity tilt, ``data_nll_continuity``).

* ``theta_scale`` ∈ R^{24×3}  — per-η-bin (A, e, M) muon scale nuisances.
* ``theta_smear`` ∈ R^{24×2}  — per-η-bin (a, c) signed width-smear coefficients.

Stage 1 (``log_p_nominal``): train the conditional flow ``p₀(m | muon_kin)`` on
simulation at θ=0 (leak-free kinematic conditioning only).

Stage 2 (``data_nll_continuity``, frozen flow): the signal density is the
nominal flow forward-folded analytically by a deterministic, invertible map
``x = μ + (1+s)(m' + s_adv(m') − μ)`` — a scale advection ``s_adv`` plus a signed
mass-density stretch ``s`` (μ = mean m_ll). ``s`` is the variance-equivalent of a
per-muon qop smear with VARIANCE ``σ²_qop = a + c·k²`` (signed/two-sided): the
smear is applied as a score-driven probability-flow displacement that reproduces
a Gaussian qop smear of mass-variance ``σ²_qop = a + c·k²`` (``_continuity_logp``),
and the SAME (a, c) drive the per-muon qop fold in the validation plots. Evaluated at
the source pre-image with the change-of-variables Jacobian (``_continuity_logp``)
— no flow derivatives, normalised by construction; the smear is a pure mass-space
stretch so it leaves the ρ conditioning untouched. Mixed with a degree-1
Bernstein background via the MLP ``f(c)``:

  data event:  p(m | c, θ) = f_0(c) p_0 + f_1(c) p_1 + (1 − f_0 − f_1)·p_s(m | c, θ)
  MC event:    p(m | c, θ) = p_s(m | c, θ)

# zuko monkey-patch: floor the jacobian before .log() in MonotonicTransform.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# zuko's ``MonotonicTransform.call_and_ladj`` returns ``y, jacobian.log()``.
# For the GF flow's GMM-CDF base, the mathematical jacobian is always
# strictly positive, but it underflows to *exactly* 0 in float32 when the
# input is far from every mixture component — typical at random init.
#  → ``log(0) = -inf`` forward → ``log_p = -inf`` → ``-log p = +inf``
#    poisons the per-batch NLL on the very first batch.
# The backward of ``log(0)`` is also degenerate (``grad_out / 0`` → ±inf
# or NaN), which is the path the anomaly tracer initially reported.
#
# Floor the jacobian at ``1e-30`` before the log: forward becomes finite
# (worst-case ``log(1e-30) ≈ -69``) and the backward is bounded
# (``clamp_min`` gradient is 0 in the clamped region, so the second-order
# autograd through the GF's f-derivative stays clean). Events at the
# clamp boundary contribute zero gradient through this layer — they're
# already in a "no signal" regime where the flow can't tell which way
# to move its mixture, so dropping their gradient is the right behaviour
# anyway; the conditioner network still receives gradient through the
# other (un-clamped) layers.
#
# We additionally clamp the transform INPUT ``x`` before ``self.f(x)``.
# The GF base maps via ``erf(x / √2)``, which in float32 saturates to
# exactly ±1 for ``|x| ≳ 5.7`` — sending the subsequent inverse-CDF / GMM
# map to ±∞ and NaN-ing the backward (the ErfBackward0 → Mul/Exp NaN the
# anomaly tracer reports). ``x`` here is *post-conditioner-affine*, so an
# external mass clamp is not enough: a sharp conditioner (or a pathological
# forward-fold mass) can push ``x`` past the saturation point even for an
# in-window event. Clamping at ±5 (erf(5/√2)=erf(3.54)=0.9999994, finite)
# is well beyond the ~N(0,1) regime the flow maps real events to, so it
# only ever bounds the pathological tail; the jacobian is taken w.r.t. the
# clamped value so the density stays self-consistent there.

          ``_softlog_below_floor`` — equal to ``log(G'.clamp_min(floor))`` in
          the physical region AND adds a C¹ quadratic barrier ``(floor−G')⁺²
          /(2·floor²)`` past the floor. The barrier value and slope are zero
          at the seam (so the physical region is unchanged) and grow
          quadratically past it, pulling G' back toward the physical region
          — replacing the hard clamp's flat-NLL basin (where the optimiser
          could drift into G' < 0 when V·∂²_m log p₀ is large at large |η|,
          with no gradient cost) with a gentle restoring force.
        * ``"exp"``: skip the autograd Jacobian and use the FROZEN-SCORE
          continuous-flow approximation ``log G' = log(1+s_adv'(m')) − V·∂²_m
          log p₀(m')/2`` — always finite, no floor needed. Approximates a
          DIFFERENT operator: assumes ∂²_m log p₀ is constant along the smear
          trajectory and is the analytic ``N→∞`` Euler-step limit of that
          frozen-score flow. Closer to the true Gaussian convolution at
          moderate V than 1-step Euler, but the assumption breaks near sharp
          features (the J/ψ peak crest) and the recovered θ may shift vs the
          'softlog' (different operator → different optimum). It also lacks
          the floor's natural cap on unphysical-sharpening rewards, so a
          large negative V is rewarded UNBOUNDEDLY by ``−log G' = +V·∂²/2``
          — only choose this when the V-too-large breakdown driving #1 is
          actually the dominant issue.
